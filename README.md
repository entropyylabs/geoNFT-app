# GeoNFT

## ✨ What is GeoNFT? ✨
GeoNFT is a blockchain-based game where brands and creators can airdrop Geo-location based NFTs. Users need to move around in the real world to collect these NFTs using the clues they get.

GeoNFT is a unique play-to-earn game where users explore places in the real world just like a treasure hunt and earn NFTs. These NFTs can be viewed in AR bringing in a metaverse-like experience.

This platform can be used by companies and creators for branding events and driving masses to their stores, exhibitions, and other such events.

## 💻🧰 How we built it 🔧🔨
GeoNFT is a mobile dApp made using React-Native. We have used the **Moralis** Ethereum react-native boilerplate to build the whole app on react native. 

The dApp uses Sequence as a wallet to onboard users quickly and let them make transactions seamlessly. 

**Moralis** is used to store all the game information and associated NFTs.

**IPFS** is used to store all the NFT images and metadata.

**Covalent** is used to get all the NFTs deployed using the smart contracts so that they can be rendered in the respective games.

The smart contract for the GeoNFTs is deployed on the **polygon** Mumbai testnet.
